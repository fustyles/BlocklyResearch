This code should probably have\n * been added to the top of the function, before merging and\n * null-removal, but was added at the bottom for now-forgotten\n * reasons.  See these bug investigations for a fuller discussion of\n * the underlying issue and some of the failures that arose because of\n * this incomplete/incorrect fix:\n *\n * https://github.com/google/blockly/issues/8225#issuecomment-2195751783\n * https://github.com/google/blockly/issues/2037#issuecomment-2209696351\n *\n * Later, in PR #1205 the original O(n^2) implementation was replaced\n * by a linear-time implementation, though additonal fixes were made\n * subsequently.\n *\n * In August 2024 a number of significant simplifications were made:\n *\n * This function was previously called from Workspace.prototype.undo,\n * but the mutation of events by this function was the cause of issue\n * #7026 (note that events would combine differently in reverse order\n * vs. forward order).  The originally-chosen fix for this was the\n * addition (in PR #7069) of code to fireNow to post-filter the\n * .undoStack_ and .redoStack_ of any workspace that had just been\n * involved in dispatching events; this apparently resolved the issue\n * but added considerable additional complexity and made it difficult\n * to reason about how events are processed for undo/redo, so both the\n * call from undo and the post-processing code was removed, and\n * forward=true was made the default while calling the function with\n * forward=false was deprecated.\n *\n * At the same time, the buggy code to reorder BlockChange events was\n * replaced by a less-buggy version of the same functionality in a new\n * function, enqueueEvent, called from fireInternal, thus assuring\n * that events will be in the correct order at the time filter is\n * called.\n *\n * Additionally, the event merging code was modified so that only\n * immediately adjacent events would be merged.
